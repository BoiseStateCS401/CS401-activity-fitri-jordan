			    	PERSONALITY
					Despite his slowness, Flash is a friendly sloth. He is polite to Judy Hopps and speaks quite professionally, which makes him sound more intelligent than he looks. Flash seems to be well acquainted with Nick Wilde and speaks to him in his casual, friendly way. He willingly helps Judy, but can be easily distracted, as seen when Nick interrupts Flash's work to tell him a joke. Flash enjoys jokes, and finds them hilarious. He even goes so far as to retell them to his co-worker, Priscilla.</strong>
